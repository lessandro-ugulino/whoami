As a senior DevOps Engineer, I was responsible for designing and implementing complex CI/CD pipelines and architecting scalable and resilient infrastructure using AWS CloudFormation and Terraform.

During my time working for Culture AMP, we designed and deployed a self-service portal using Ansible, Python, Jenkins, PowerShell, and AWS CloudFormation to help the development and infrastructure team release and speed up the process of delivering new applications.

In this portal, the engineers could launch new EC2 instances as well as AWS Lambdas using a drop-down list.

**Here you can see an example of the DevOps tools available on this portal** -> https://github.com/lessandro-ugulino/devops-tools?tab=readme-ov-file#tools
